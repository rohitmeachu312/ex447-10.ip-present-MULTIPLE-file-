there are two files ips and ips2 .... both ahve the ips. we need to collect the ips from both files and paste them into ip.out file inside same directory path


---
- name: IP Address
  hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: false
  vars_files:
    - files.yml
  tasks:

    - name: copy contents
      shell: echo "{{ lookup('file',item) }}" >> rohit.txt
      loop: "{{ files }}"

    - name: copy ip
      copy:
        dest: ip.out
        content: "IPADDR={{lookup('file','rohit.txt').split()|ipaddr|unique|join(',')|default('none',true)}}"     

    - name: remove file
      file:
        path: rohit.txt
        state: absent
